For instance, this sentence\n  * \"He ate his breakfast and then went to the store.\"\n  has two events:\n(i) he ate breakfast, and\n  (ii) he went to the store.\n  Negative events are still valid events. For instance, in this sentence,\n  * 'He didn't eat his breakfast and he didn't go to the store, either.'\n  * \"He didn't eat breakfast\" and \"he didn't go to the store\" are both correct events.\n  An event can have a confidence level. For instance, in\n  * \"He might have eaten his breakfast and gone to the store.\"\n  * \"He probably/possibly/barely/... had his breakfast and went to the store.\"\n  \"Have breakfast\" and \"go to the store\" are still valid events in our definition, although the speaker is not 100% sure about it.\n  In summary, an event can be factual or hypothetical, positive or negative, certain or uncertain. All events above are based on verbs, but an event can also be based on a noun or a copula verb (is, was, been, etc.). Check these examples below to get a more accurate understanding of what we mean by \"events.\"\n\n  | Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |\n  |----------|:-------------:|------:|\n  | col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |\n  | col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |\n  | col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |\n  "
